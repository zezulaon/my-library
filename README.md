My Library
==================
**work in progress** ðŸš§

**My Library** is an Android app for managing books and shelves built entirely with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

Some parts of the app were inspired by the [Now in Android](https://developer.android.com/series/now-in-android)
Android showcase app.

# Components/libraries/services used

* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
* [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)
* [Koin for DI](https://insert-koin.io/)
* [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning) (Barcode scanning)
* [Camera X](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Firestore, Auth, Crashlytics)
* [GoodReads Review API](https://www.goodreads.com/api) (Books data and reviews)

#### UI
The screens and UI components were designed using [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/) and build in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) as a _single Activity_ app. Screen UI state is managed and provided by Android _ViewModel_ (which also handles events coming from UI or Data layer).

#### Android Room
Android **Room DB** is used as a _single source of truth_ for the user data. All data coming from the network are first stored in the DB and then exposed to ViewModel via _Flow_ or as a result of a _suspend functions_.

#### Fireabase
**Firebase Firestore** is used to back up and sync a user's data. Currently the Firestore is used only for simple Add/Remove queries. (Complex search/join quires are handled by Room DB).
**Firebase Auth** is also used to sign user in the app. (Either via Google or as an Anonymous user).

#### Architecture
*My Library* tries to follow latest Android architecture recommendation and separates code into several layers: **UI Layer** (Compose and ViewModels), **Domain Layer**, **Data Layer** (Repositores and Data Sources). (Though use of **Domain Layer** is perhaps redundant - because of the small portion of business logic, the _Use Cases_ are mostly just delegating call to _Repositories_).

# SetUp
To compile and run the app, you will have to provide:
* [google-service.json file](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) (With Firestore/Auth/Crashlytics enabled)
* [Firebase Web Client ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/google-signin) (For user Sign In)
* [GoodReads API Key](https://www.goodreads.com/api) (For fetching books and reviews)

These keys go to the app's <code>gradle.properties</code>:
~~~~
myLibrary.goodreadsApiKey=GOODREADS_API_KEY
myLibrary.firebaseClientId=FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID
